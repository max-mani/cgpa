🚀 Excited to share my latest project: KCT CSE CGPA Calculator!

A few days ago, I received my 4th semester results—and honestly, they weren't as great as I'd hoped. Like many students, the first thing I wanted to do was check my overall CGPA and see where I stood. My friend Faizal had previously built a handy website to calculate the SGPA for just this semester, so I reached out and asked if he could extend it to cover all 4 semesters. But with his own busy schedule, he couldn't take it up right away.

That's when I had a lightbulb moment: why not build it myself? As a web developer, I've always enjoyed creating tools that solve real problems. I wanted something that would not only help me, but also my friends and anyone else at KCT who needed a quick, accurate way to calculate their CGPA. And so, this project was born!

What does this website do?
📚 Allows KCT students to calculate their SGPA for each semester and their overall CGPA, following the official curriculum.
📝 Now, students from any department can use this website! You can edit the course list and credits for each semester, so it's not limited to CSE—just update the courses to match your department.
🎨 Features a beautiful, mobile-friendly UI with KCT branding.
🛠️ Built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.

How does it work?
- Select your grades for each course (including language elective).
- Edit, add, or remove courses and credits as per your department's curriculum.
- The website automatically calculates your SGPA for each semester and your overall CGPA.
